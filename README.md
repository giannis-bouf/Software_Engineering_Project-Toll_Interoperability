# Toll Interoperability System

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Toll Interoperability System** designed to manage and facilitate toll collection across multiple toll operators. The system provides both frontend and backend components to support toll operations, data management, and user interactions through various interfaces.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### Directory Contents

- **`back-end/`** - Backend Application Server
  - Source code for toll interoperability data management and processing
  - RESTful API endpoints for client communication
  - Database integration and data persistence
  - Functional and unit tests for backend services
  - Database schema and SQL dumps

- **`front-end/`** - User Interface
  - Web-based frontend application
  - User interaction components for toll management
  - Integration with backend API services

- **`cli-client/`** - Command-Line Interface
  - Command-line tool for backend interaction
  - Batch processing and administrative operations
  - Direct system access for advanced users

- **`documentation/`** - Project Documentation
  - API documentation
  - System architecture and design documents
  - User guides and setup instructions
  - Technical specifications

- **`ai-log/`** - AI Tool Logs and Records
  - Records from AI tool interactions and questionnaires
  - Metadata and dialogue logs from the NTUA/ECE Software Engineering AI tools
  - Timestamped submissions for tracking project development

- **`.gitignore`** - Git Configuration
  - Standard Git ignore patterns for the project

## Technology Stack

The system follows a modern web architecture with:
- **Backend**: RESTful API for data operations and toll management
- **Frontend**: Web-based user interface for system interaction
- **Database**: SQL-based data persistence layer
